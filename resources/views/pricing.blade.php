                            According to <strong>FINPROV</strong>, “Accounting is a language of the business”. We need the proper accounting records to better
                            communicate the financial performance and the financial position of the business. For the accounting to portray the true and fair
                            view image of the business, it should be prepared by the people who understand the accounting process. In OPA,
                            we help the trainees understand the process of accounting which includes identifying, classing, recording, summarizing,
                            and reporting the financial data so that he/she can be able to communicate the business image.
